#   Spring Professional

This repository contains code that I created while studying for the
[VMware Spring Professional 2021 Certification](https://www.vmware.com/education-services/certification/vcp-spring.html)

Most code is just to help solidify a concept. Some of it is even tested!

I also tried to answer all the questions from the [Study Guide](https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/certification/vmw-spring-professional-certification-study-guide.pdf):

*   [Section 1: Container, Dependency, and IOC](SECTION-1.md)
*   [Section 2: Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)](SECTION-2.md)
*   [Section 3: Data Management: JDBC, Transactions](SECTION-3.md)
